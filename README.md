The main objective of this project was to use asynchronous JS (async/await, promises).

The weather data is provided by [openWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and retireved using the [One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api); the geopgraphical coordinates for the selected city are obtained with the [geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api); the weather icons are part of an extensive collection of icons made available by [Erik Flowers](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/); the background images were designed by [upklyak]( uphttps://www.freepik.com/upklyak) and are available at [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/).

The app was developed in the context of Odin's Project, as indicated in the [specifications](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).
